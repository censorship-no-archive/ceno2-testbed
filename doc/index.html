<h1>CENO network measurement project</h1>
<p>This initiative attempts to measure network filtering around you.
  Your computer <em>node</em> will participate in a group running a series of network tests
  covering different connectivity scenarios with
  servers in censorship-free zones and other nodes running similar tests in the same potentially censored zone.
  Normal client-server as well as peer-to-peer communication protocols are used to
  compare how all of the nodes will behave and detect possible interference
  (like traffic throttling or filtering).</p>
